<h1>Adventure World!</h1>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ul>

    <li>This is a text-based game in Python. I am using Trinket.io to run the code in the browser. For best results maximize
        the browser window and maximize the Trinket.io output window. The code and other files can be viewed in the left
        frame. Press the "Run" button to play the game on the right side. I did not make the ASCII art.</li>

    <li>The hero is the "star" icon.</li>

    <li>In practice mode all enemies are ogre types with one choice of weapon and everything on the game board is visible.</li>

    <li>In normal mode enemies can be either goblins or ogres and weapon type and strength can vary. Only objects within
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry" target="_blank">Taxicab Distance</a> of 3 are visible.</li>

    <li>The hero can move up, down, left, or right. To attack, have a friendly encounter, or pick up a new weapon
        simply move into that square. Be aware that enemies can attack the hero too.</li>

    <li>Unicorns give the gift of life, or tell you a fortune if you are already maxed out on life.</li>

    <li>Friendly Trolls tell you where you the map is, or share an uplifting (but totally vague) message if you already found it.</li>

    <li>If you find the map the castle will be visible, but you can also find the castle without it.</li>

    <li>Once you enter the castle, there is no turning back and you have to defeat the dragon before taking the treasure
        (the "crown" icon).</li>

    <li>Every step takes one life point and you can die of exhaustion.</li>

    <li>Battles with enemies are Rock/Paper/Scissor style. You can always run away if you get scared.</li>

    <li>Sword icons represent weapons that can be traded for the one you currently hold. The Hero always starts with a dagger.
        Defeat an enemy and that enemy's weapon is available for picking up.
        If you decide to trade weapons you will leave the one you currently own. Possible weapons are dagger, battle axe, broad
        sword and lightning (the most powerful weapon in the universe). Broad sword or lightning is recommended before entering
        the castle. Defeating an enemy also increases your experience points which makes you stronger in battle.</li>

    <li>Tacos represent good things (naturally). It could be food, could be a place to take a nap, but it could also be a trap.</li>

    <li>Hopefully this is all clear. If you notice any bugs or have any questions please e-mail me at
        <a href="mailto:justin@justinlmartin.com" target="_blank">justin@justinlmartin.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Good Luck Brave Hero!</h2>
