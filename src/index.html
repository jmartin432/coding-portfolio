            <h2 class="resume_section">SUMMARY</h2>
            I am an experienced Quality Assurance Engineer with strong coding skills in a variety of languages and frameworks
            and specialize in creating functional, performance and integration testing paradigms that are automated, dynamic

            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am currently working as a contract Quality Assurance Engineer with Nike in Portland, Oregon. I am recent graduate
            of the Full Stack Web Development Course at PDX Code Guild (April, 2018). The majority of my work experience has been
            in forward-facing
            roles in military, educational and guest-services environments with an emphasis on leadership, management and
            communication in rapidly changing and uncertain conditions. I possess strong technical, analytical, communication
            and problem-solving skills. I have a natural inclination toward
            computer coding, seek out challenges and embrace opportunities to explore new technologies. My primary coding
            languages are Python and Javascript and my coding interests are in algorithm design, optimization and efficiency
            and visualization of information and data.</p>

            <p>Originally I am from New Jersey but between there and here, I served four years in the US Army as a
            Reconnaissance Specialist (19D Cavalry Scout to be precise) in South Korea and Afghanistan and earned a degree
            in Mathematics from Rutgers University. I have worked in New England as an outdoor educator, wilderness emergency medical
            technician, wilderness therapy guide, backcountry caretaker in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and math teacher
            at a school for competitive skiers and snowboarders. I have volunteered in
            the Amazon rain forest as an animal welfare advocate
            and in rural Romania as an organic farm worker (and co-organizer of the 2nd Annual Red Onion Festival of Ideciu
            de Jos; so much fun!) I have walked the Camino de Santiago across northern Spain, hiked the Long Trail in Vermont and
            once spent a month wandering around the Escalante River Valley as a student on the 28-day field survival course at the Boulder
            Outdoor Survival School in Boulder, Utah.</p>

            <p>My other interests include juggling; I am a volunteer juggling instructor for the Portland Juggling Club, and have served
            on the planning committee and as volunteer coordinator for the Portland Juggling Festival in 2016, 2017, and 2018. I am
            currently a student of Improvisational Theater at the Brody Theater in Downtown Portland and have a few crafty hobbies
            like soap-making, leather-work and bookbinding. Actually, it was a shoe-making workshop that brought me out to Portland
            in the first place. I also like to snowboard.</p>

            <p>This website is a work in progress so please check back often as
            I will be adding code examples and descriptions as I go. For now please check out my LinkedIn, Github and Codepen
            or send me an e-mail to learn more.</p>

                        a fixed amount and with some simple modular arithmetic, creates a sequence of images that cycle back
                        to the original. The sequence is saved as an animated GIF. It looks really cool.<br>
